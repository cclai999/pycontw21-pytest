Python Testing 101 with pytest - March 2019

This repository was for the March 2019 presentation
at Python Frederick.

Our goal was to show off pytest
and how to do automated testing
in your projects.

## Getting started

Create a virtual environment to hold your local packages
(i.e. `pytest`).

```bash
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

Install `pytest` from PyPI.

```bash
(venv) $ pip install pytest
```

## Run the tests

You can run the tests for this project
by running `pytest`.

```bash
$ pytest
```
